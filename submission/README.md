Submission Guide
================

Use this folder to store proof of completion (screenshots) and track your PR/issue workflow.

What to collect
---------------
- Lab 1: `01-hello-world-output.png`, `02-docker-ps.png`
- Lab 2: `03-build-output.png`, `04-curl-response.png`
- Lab 3: `05-compose-ps.png`, `06-nginx-curl.png`
- Optional Lab 4: `07-registry-tag.png`

How to submit
-------------
1) Finish the labs in `docs/hands-on.md` and save the screenshots above into `submission/screenshots/`.
2) Open a PR with your changes (screenshots and any notes).
3) Create an issue using the “Submission” template. Include links to your PR and mention any blockers.
4) Automation will label the issue (`submission`, `pending review`) and keep it open until `nisalgunawardhana` closes it.
5) When approved and closed by `nisalgunawardhana`, the automation will post a completion comment and the Docker 101 badge.

Tips
----
- Keep screenshot filenames consistent so reviewers can quickly map them to labs.
- If you iterate, keep older screenshots but suffix with `-v2` to show progress.
- Add brief notes in the PR description about what you learned or any hiccups for reviewer context.
